Remember that in this section all rings are taken to be \emph{commutative}.

\hypertarget{Exercise V.1.1}{}
\begin{problem}[1.1]
	$\triangleright$ Let $R$ be a Noetherian ring, and let $I$ be an ideal of $R$. Prove that $R / I$ is a Noetherian ring. [\textsection1.1]
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
	Let $\pi:R\to R / I$ be the projection. According to \hyperlink{Exercise III.4.2}{Exercise III.4.2}, the homomorphic image of the Noetherian ring $R$ is Noetherian. That is, $\pi(R)=R / I$ is Noetherian.
\end{solution}

\begin{problem}[1.2]
Prove that if $R[x]$ is Noetherian, so is $R$. (This is a `converse' to Hilbert's basis theorem.)
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
According to \hyperlink{Exercise V.1.1}{Exercise V.1.1}, $R[x]$ is Noetherian implies $R\left[x\right]/\left(x\right)$ is Noetherian. Since in \hyperlink{Exercise III.4.12}{Exercise III.4.12} we have shown that
\[
R\cong R\left[x\right]/\left(x\right),
\]
we see $R$ is Noetherian.
\end{solution}
